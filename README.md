# ITLOM
In the Lense of Merlina

This is stil an on going project that is still in the process of going. The part where the idea of this project came from was when I was just interested in doing something 
new and experince and learn some new skills that I might be able to use for my future projects, I wanted to make more websites but ones that didn't revolve around me but on other's
and there life & that's what this is exactly about one of my closet friends who I've met this year who i gotten really close with in the recent months. The website will be around photography, 
my friend is currently intertested in the field of photography and that's something that they want to do in the future when they graduate High School. I thought this will be a very fun & enjoyable 
project to start and do for my first collaberation with someone.
